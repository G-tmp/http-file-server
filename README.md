## TODO

* response correct Mimeâ€‘Type, by file signature maybe

* post request only supports upload one file, it is tedious to parse post body

* sort files by name, size  or last modified time

* chunked transfer encoding

* http pipelining

* sometimes the socket connection is disconnected for unknown reasons
